# Framework details

## How it works

**monomod** is a TypeScript framework designed for building highly scalable and maintainable applications using a modular monolith architecture.

## why not miroservives?

Microservices are a good approach for building highly scalable and maintainable applications, but they have some drawbacks:

- **Complexity:** Microservices require a more complex architecture, including service discovery, load balancing, and distributed tracing.
- **Performance:** Microservices can introduce additional latency due to inter-service communication.
- **Cost:** Microservices can be more expensive to maintain and operate, especially in large-scale applications.

These drawbacks are not present in a monolith architecture, but the monolith architecture has some drawbacks:

- **Scalability:** Monoliths can be difficult to scale horizontally.
- **Maintainability:** Monoliths can be difficult to maintain, especially in large-scale applications.

## Why monomod?

**monomod** is the perfect starting point for new projects, offering a strategic balance between monolithic simplicity and microservices scalability. It provides an ideal path for growth without the initial complexity.

- **Perfect for Startups and Growing Projects:** Start with the simplicity of a monolith but maintain the ability to easily transition to microservices as your application scales.
- **Best of Both Worlds:** Enjoy modular development and independence like microservices, while avoiding the drawbacks of microservices.
- **Migration-Ready:** Easily transition to microservices when needed, without the initial complexity.
- **Future-Proof Architecture:** Begin with a clean, maintainable monolith that's pre-structured for eventual microservices migration, eliminating future architectural debt.
- **Simplified Development and Performance:** Benefit from fast development cycles and superior performance with minimal communication overhead, while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
- **Framework-Agnostic:** Works with your preferred backend framework. The default configurated framework is express, but you can configure any other framework like NestJS, Koa, Fastify or your preferred framework.
- **Maximum Flexibility:** Choose your preferred backend framework and seamlessly deploy anywhere - from simple VPS to complex cloud infrastructures.
